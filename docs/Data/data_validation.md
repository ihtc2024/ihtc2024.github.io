<!--TODO: reorder competition pages+should we add the test instances already (or at least before the competition starts)? What to do with `json.hpp`?-->

## Dataset

Instances are provided in JSON format with the fixed structure that is described in detail in [Input](input). Each instance is contained in a single file.

We provide a _public_ dataset composed of 30 instances, named `i01`, ... `i30`, with a scheduling period ranging from 2 to 4 weeks, and a number of patients ranging from about 50 to about 500.

In addition, we provide 5 test instances, `test01`, ... `test05` for testing and debugging purposes. For the test dataset, we also provide a solution for each specific instance. 

The organizers will employ a different _hidden_ dataset to evaluate the participants' submissions. This dataset will be shared with the participants towards the end of the competition.
Both the _public_ and _hidden_ datasets are artificial, and they are generated by the same instance generator that uses realistic patterns and distributions.

The solution needs to be provided in a single JSON file, and its format is described in [Output](output_format).
