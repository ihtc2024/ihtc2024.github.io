TODO: add competition rules

**Rule 1**: The organisers reserve the right to update the
  rules at any time, if they believe it is necessary for the sake of
  preserving the correct operation of the competition. Any change of
  rules will be notified in the repository.

**Rule 2**: The competition has deadlines when all
  submissions must be uploaded. These deadlines are strict and no
  extensions will be given under any circumstances.
